Qb is an HTML / JavaScript / webGL cube simulator that renders an interactable cube in browser. Users can click on the cube, rotate the camera, and toss the cube.

# MVP & Functionality

1. 3d rendered cube

2. drag cube to move around

3. gravity that affects cube within scene

4. navigatable camera

# Architecture and Technologies

Qb will utilize the following technologies: 

1. JavaScript for game physics / logic

2. HTML for canvas rendering

3. WebGL API for drawing 3D graphics

4. CSS for styling

5. Webpack for managing node modules

# Implementation Timeline

## Day 1

1. Learn how to render 3d objects in webGL. Glean an understanding of how webGL technology works. (C++ components, shader program, CPU vs GPU's role, rendering)

## Day 2

1. Research / implement interacting with rendered webGL objects.

NOTE: The majority of this project will be pursued post App Academy completion, and should be considered in its entirety as a bonus / journey in self discovery.
